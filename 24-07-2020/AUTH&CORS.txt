CORS:
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser mechanism which enables controlled access to resources located outside of a given domain. It extends and adds flexibility to the same-origin policy (SOP). However, it also provides potential for cross-domain based attacks, if a website's CORS policy is poorly configured and implemented. CORS is not a protection against cross-origin attacks such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

AUTH:
In System, the term authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a person or device. A common example is entering a username and password when you log in to a website. Entering the correct login information lets the website know 1) who you are and 2) that it is actually you accessing the website.
the username and password is the common way to authenticate your identity.
